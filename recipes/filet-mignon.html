                <p>This recipe is for a classic filet mignon, known for its tenderness and rich flavor. The steak is
                    lightly
                    seasoned with salt and pepper, then seared to perfection in a hot cast-iron skillet, creating a
                    beautiful
                    crust.
                    Afterward, it's finished in the oven to achieve the perfect level of doneness. A simple pan sauce
                    made
                    with
                    butter, garlic, and fresh thyme enhances the steak’s natural flavor, making this dish a
                    restaurant-quality
                    meal
                    that’s surprisingly easy to prepare at home. Whether served with roasted vegetables, mashed
                    potatoes, or
                    a
                    fresh
                    salad, this filet mignon will impress every time.
